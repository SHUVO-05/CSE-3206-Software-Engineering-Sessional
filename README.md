# [Project Name] - Full Stack Web Application

A comprehensive overview of what a Full Stack Web Development project is, its components, and the technology stack required to build one.

## What is a Full Stack Web Project?
In simple terms, a **Full Stack Web Development Project** is a complete website or web application where both the parts users see (**Front-end**) and the background logic, databases, and servers (**Back-end**) work together seamlessly.

In a full-stack project, a user can input data, that data is processed and saved, and it can be retrieved later. Examples include Facebook, Amazon, or Foodpanda.

## The 3 Main Components

### 1. Front-end (Client-side)
This is the part users see in their browser—buttons, menus, forms, and layouts. It focuses on user experience (UX) and interface (UI).

### 2. Back-end (Server-side)
The "behind the scenes" part. It processes user requests, handles security, and applies business logic.

### 3. Database
The storage room where all data (like usernames, passwords, and posts) is permanently saved.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Requirements

To build a full-stack application, the following technologies are essential:

### 🔹 Front-end Development
* **HTML5:** Build the skeleton/structure of the website.
* **CSS3:** Styling, colors, and making the site **Responsive** (Mobile-friendly).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Making the website interactive and dynamic.
* **Frameworks:** [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### 🔹 Back-end Development
* **Node.js:** JavaScript-based runtime (Framework: **Express.js**).
* **Python:** Frameworks like **Django** or **Flask**.
* **PHP:** Framework like **Laravel**.

### 🔹 Database
* **NoSQL:** [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Great for Node.js).
* **SQL:** [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

### 🔹 Essential Tools
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control and code management.
* **API (REST/GraphQL):** The bridge between Front-end and Back-end.
* **Deployment:** Platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).
